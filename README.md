**XP Core Values**

Sudha VijayKumar - Courage 

I strongly believed in team effort and tried encouraging everyone to participate in every discussion and made sure that everyone is heard so that every team member is equally valued and no one is left out.Showed each team member respect and integrity based on the opinions that they had for the expectations of our project.

Asad Abbasi- Simplicity

I tried keeping the requirements simple, short and clear. I tried to keep the implementation simple in the beginning to have a basic working model so that the final application can be built on top of it.To keep things simple I encouraged my team to granularize the requirement into smaller user stories.

Nithil Sethupathi - Respect

I was quick to set up meetings when any of the team member’s had integration issues. Also respected others opinions when building the application and tried to reach consensus among the team. I tried to make sure everyone is equally respected with their new attempts.

Venkata Lakshmi Pravallika Ramachandruni - Communication

I constantly encouraged my team to communicate with each other about their ideas and issues they faced.I Brainstormed the requirement with the team and came up with collaborative ideas. Updated the team continuously on pending deliverables.
